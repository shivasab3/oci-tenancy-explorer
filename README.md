# OCI Tenancy Explorer

OCI Tenancy Explorer is a lightweight dashboard for viewing OCI compute maintenance and reboot-related signals across a tenancy.

The project has three main parts:

- `build_fleet_data.py`: collects OCI data and writes `fleet_data.json`
- `portal_server.py`: serves the UI and provides refresh endpoints
- `index.html`: renders the tenancy dashboard from `fleet_data.json`

## Quick Start (Direct)

1. Install Python dependency:

```bash
python3 -m pip install oci
```

2. Build the initial snapshot:

```bash
python3 build_fleet_data.py --profile DEFAULT --output fleet_data.json
```

3. Start the local portal:

```bash
python3 portal_server.py --profile DEFAULT
```

4. Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8765/index.html
```

Notes:
- Configure OCI auth via `~/.oci/config` (see `oci_config.example`) or use `--auth instance_principal` when running on OCI compute.
- Keep `fleet_data.json` local; it contains tenancy metadata.

## Quick Start (Docker)

Build and run:

```bash
docker build -t oci-tenancy-explorer .
docker run --rm -p 8765:8765 \
  -e OCI_AUTH=config \
  -e OCI_PROFILE=DEFAULT \
  -e OCI_CONFIG_FILE=/home/appuser/.oci/config \
  -v ~/.oci:/home/appuser/.oci:ro \
  -v ~/.ssh:/home/appuser/.ssh:ro \
  oci-tenancy-explorer
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8765/index.html
```

Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

For OCI instance principal on an OCI host:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.oci-instance-principal.yml up --build
```
